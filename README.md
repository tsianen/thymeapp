# Thyme App

Thyme is a comprehensive, modern day tool for busy people. It aims to find the gaps between two or more schedules to help quickly and conveniently schedule your next meeting. 

So far we have created a landing page, sparking interest in the general community. Though, we did not have time to create an entire “tester” app. Instead, we are still in the phase of seeking conceptual and technical advice.

This is the link to our landing page hosted using Cyberduck and the UVIC server: http://web.uvic.ca/~tsianen/thymeapp/index.html

This repository contains all the files for this landing page.
